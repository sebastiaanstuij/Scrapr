Scrapr
======

Scrapr is an Android app which can be used to take screenshots of selected areas of interest on a website, which is then OCR'ed
to produce clear text. This process is repeated in regular intervals and the returned text is compared to a predefined setting and 
will eventually notify the user with the desired information.
